This repository contains a very simple academic website template (screenshot below).

To use it, fork this repo, ssh into unix.ucsc.edu (NOTE: may have recently changed to peopleweb-shell.prd.web.aws.ucsc.edu, and it now uses your gold, or 'normal', password), clone your fork, and then copy the contents (including the .git folder) into your `public_html` directory. Be sure to update the content and then commit and push the changes. 

You can view your website at `people.ucsc.edu/~yourCruzID/`
